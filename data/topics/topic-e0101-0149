The establishment of safe and effective methods of preventing viral diseases, such as hepatitis, is an important task for medicine as it approaches the 21st century. Therefore, a relevant document must discuss the development of hepatitis B vaccines by genetic engineering techniques. It should also deal with the physical properties of hepatitis B vaccines that have been developed and immunologic adjuvants that are effective in increasing immunity to the vaccines. However, documents that do not mention genetic engineering techniques or those dealing with vaccines other than for hepatitis B are not considered relevant.

</DESCRIPTION>

<NARRATIVE>
Pancreatic islet transplantation has attracted attention as a method that allows radical cure of diabetes mellitus instead of conventional treatment by insulin injection therapy or antidiabetic agents. There is a desire to implement xenotransplantation in view of the problem of donor shortage for transplantation therapy, but overcoming rejection reactions is a major hurdle. Therefore, a relevant document will discuss cases of graft survival for 50 days or more without combined use of immunosuppressive agents for allogeneic or xenogeneic pancreatic islet grafts to treat diabetes mellitus. Provided that a document contains specific information on long-term graft survival and long-term normoglycemia, even if the duration of viability is not stated, it is relevant. However, documents on insulin injection-type artificial islets or only syngeneic grafts are not relevant.

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is the most popular transport protocol in networks. TCP first establishes a connection between hosts and gives reliable data transmission by the interaction of packets and their acknowledgements. However, TCP cannot use the whole bandwidth of a wide area or high-speed network, because the congestion avoidance algorithm used for TCP is unsuitable for this kind of network. Methods of improving TCP to speed up the transmission rate satisfy the request. Methods that depend on an access link such as satellite communication also satisfy the request if they speed up the transmission rate of TCP. Research referring only to the limitation of transmission rate in TCP does not satisfy the request.

<DESCRIPTION>
What kinds of singularities inevitably appear in physical systems as the solutions of differential equations?
</DESCRIPTION>

<NARRATIVE>
In a certain kind of partial differential equation, singularities inevitably appear with time evolution, even if there is no singularity in the boundary condition at the initial state. A relevant document would contain an example of a singularity that appears inevitably in the physical system. A relevant document may also contain a theorem in which the existence of a singularity is shown under a certain physical assumption by making use of a differential equation. However, documents are not relevant if they do not refer to the necessity of the singularity, or if they treat only the mathematical characteristics of the equation or the singularity, with no physical object specified. A singularity not related to a differential equation, such as in a image, is also not relevant.

Higgs boson
</TITLE>

<DESCRIPTION>
How is the mass of the Higgs boson predicted?
</DESCRIPTION>

<NARRATIVE>
The Higgs boson is the only particle that appears in the standard theory of elementary particles that has not yet been observed experimentally. However, because the form of its interaction is determined, the mass can be predicted from experimental results of reactions in which the Higgs boson indirectly takes part. An experimental result on the mass of the Higgs boson would be relevant, as also would be a theoretical prediction of the mass, including such topics as the range of values it should take, the method used to estimate it, and the reactions involved. In particular, a document in which an experiment is concretely compared with the theory would be most relevant.
