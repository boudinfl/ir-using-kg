# Looking at absent keyphrases

## Retrieval results

Results for retrieval models using keyphrase generation are reported in the
table below.  Two initial indexing configurations are examined: title and 
abstract only (T+A), and title, abstract and author keywords (T+A+K).

## Analysis of query qrels

### Positive example

```
<top>
<num> Number: 110
<title>Visualization of information retrieval

<desc> Description:
Are there documents about systems supporting information retrieval with 
information visualization?

<narr> Narrative:
As information available through the Internet increases, the burden of
retrieving information becomes greater. There are limitations to the customary
method, which simply displays document titles agreeing with the retrieval query.
I want to survey papers about systems that reduce the burden on users by using
information visualization to realize efficient information retrieval. Even if a
paper does not discuss a retrieval system on networks, if it concerns systems
that support users visually, it is relevant.

<TITLE>Multmedia Information Retrieval and Acquisition Interface with
       Interactive Information Visualization</TITLE>
<TEXT>We have developed new visual interaction techniques to obtain information
      from a very large and broad collection of data. Our techniques organize
      and visualize information dynamically, and navigate a user to explore the
      information space.First, We have developed a dynamic layout algorithm of
      documents and keywords and a visual interaction technique based on this
      algorithm to explore a large collection of documents. This algorithm,
      "forcedirected dynamic layout algorithm", introduces a spring model to
      represent the document space and lays out documents and keywords according
      to these relevance. By introducing dynamic and continuous manipulation of
      visualized data into the visual clustering, our technique enables a user
      to explore the information space according to his/her own point of view.
      We have implemented an experimental visualization system, dalled
      "DocSpace", based on our technique.Second, we have developed a visual
      interface for information mediating systems. There have been proposed
      "collaborative filtering" techniques that utilize recommendations of
      others to customize information filters. However, we need not only
      filtered data but also their relationships in the context of the whole
      information that has various trends of interests. We have therefore
      developed an information mediating system that vesualizes information
      space composed of reviewers and reviewed items. We have implemented the
      experimental system, "CinemaScape", that mediates movie reviews.</TEXT>

### Negative example

<num> Number: 142
<title>Paraphrase

<desc> Description:
Papers which discuss paraphrasing

<narr> Narrative:
I want papers written about paraphrase, which is defined as the transformation 
of an expression to a different one with the same meaning in the same language.
Paraphrase includes not only syntactical transformation but also morphological
or semantic transformation in which derivatives or synonyms appear. Further,
paraphrase is not necessarily a transformation to a simpler expression. A paper
written about the application of paraphrase also satisfies this retrieval
request.
